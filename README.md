# 'generic-resource-utility' branch
In this branch all Resource classes should be updated to use static utility generic methods from
a generic Resource utility class.

The generic Resource utility class is not supposed to be inherited, it has static methods only.

The generic Resource utility class is usefull to avoid code repetition for the CRUD operations.
Any other operations must be added and implemented in a concrete Resource class.
