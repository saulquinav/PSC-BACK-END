# 'generic-utility-service' branch
In this branch all Service classes have been updated to use static utility generic methods from
the GenericServiceUtility class.

The GenericServiceUtility class is not supposed to be inherited, it has static methods only.

The GenericServiceUtility class has built-in ready-made static methods for the basic
CRUD operations: create, findById(), findAll(), update(), delete().

The GenericServiceUtility class is usefull to avoid code repetition for the CRUD operations.
Any other operations must be added and implemented in a concrete Service class.
